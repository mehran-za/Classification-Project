# Classification-Project
The dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted. Based on this date we build a model to predict the future behavior of other costumers.
The dataset includes following fields:

 Loan_status    | Whether a loan is paid off on in collection                                           |
| Principal      | Basic principal loan amount at the                                                    |
| Terms          | Origination terms which can be weekly (7 days), biweekly, and monthly payoff schedule |
| Effective_date | When the loan got originated and took effects                                         |
| Due_date       | Since itâ€™s one-time payoff schedule, each loan has one single due date                |
| Age            | Age of applicant                                                                      |
| Education      | Education of applicant                                                                |
| Gender         | The gender of applicant                                                               |

Then we use 

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)-
Decision Tree-
Random Forest-
Support Vector Machine-
Logistic Regression-

to build our models and finally report the accuracy of the built model using different evaluation metrics:
Jaccard-
F1-score-
LogLoss
